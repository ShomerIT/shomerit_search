# About ShomerIT Search

ShomerIT is a [metasearch engine], aggregating the results of other search 
engines while not storing information about its users.

## Why use it?

- ShomerIT Search does not collect information about your searches, never
  shares them with third-parties, and it can't be used to compromise you.
- ShomerIT Search filters your search results to make sure you never
  end up on an inappropriate page.
- ShomerIT Search is based on free software, allowing you check and verify
  most of the code yourself.

If you do care about privacy or want to be a conscious user make ShomerIT Search 
your default search engine!

## How do I set it as the default search engine?

ShomerIT Search supports [OpenSearch].  For more information on changing your default
search engine, see your browser's documentation:

- [Firefox]
- [Microsoft Edge] - Behind the link, you will also find some useful instructions
  for Chrome and Safari.
- [Chromium]-based browsers only add websites that the user navigates to without
  a path.

## How does it work?

ShomerIT Search is a fork from the well-known [SearXNG] [metasearch engine].  
It provides basic privacy by mixing your queries with searches on other platforms 
without storing search data. ShomerIT Search can be added to your browser's search bar; 
moreover, it can be set as the default search engine.
